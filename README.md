# Exponential Idle Arrow Game Auto solver (Medium difficulty)
This is a little project to (as the title suggests) solve the arrow game of the idle game Exponential Idle automatically. 

The approach of this program is simple. 

1. Replicate the game board using arrays and make it playable inside python itself. 
2. Solve the board using algorithms found [here][1]
3. Recreate the steps using by clicking on the screen, but no too fast to compensate with potential input lag. 
4. Voila!
